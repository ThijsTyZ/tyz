    text: `Having worked with Thijs over a period of more than 15 years, I
can honestly say that Thijs is one of the people I have enjoyed
most working with. Thijs is a hard worker, with great dedication
and focus, who will always go the extra mile to reach the best
result possible. As a developer he has vast knowledge of the field
he is active in, always strives for improvements, and puts quality
first. He has a broad perspective, always trying to view things
from multiple sides, and is always willing to learn new things. As
a team lead Thijs takes great care of his team members, putting
their interests in favour of his own, while using a personal
approach to each and every one to make sure they have an optimal
environment to work, thrive and develop in. Besides that, Thijs is
generally a really nice guy with a great sense of humour, easy
going and flexible, with a strong focus on principles without
being dogmatic. Any company should feel proud and blessed to have
Thijs in their team.`,
